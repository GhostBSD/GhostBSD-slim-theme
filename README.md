GhostBSD themes for SLiM

## What is SLiM?
[SLiM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/slim.berlios/) is an acronym for "Simple Login Manager". Lightweight and easily configurable, SLiM requires minimal dependencies, and none from the *GNOME* or *KDE* desktop environments. It therefore contributes towards a lightweight system for users that also like to use lightweight desktops such as *MATE*, *Xfce*, *Openbox*, and *Fluxbox*. 

**Warning** : The SliM project has been abandoned (last release was 2013, the project homepage is down).
